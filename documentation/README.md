## Configuration for SMS API Documentation.

### This documentation is created using `sphinx`. To get started with sphinx, run the following commands:

1. Install sphinx into your environment with `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install sphinx sphinx-autodoc-typehints
   ```
2. Create a `docs` or `documentation` directory at the root of the `bio-compose` repo:
   ```bash
   mkdir documentation && cd documentation
   ```
3. Run sphinx quickstart in documentation directory:
   ```bash
   sphinx-quickstart
   ```
4. Ensure auto-complete of documentation is possible from the package's docstrings in the autogenerated `conf.py` from #3:
   ```python
   extensions = [
       'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
       'sphinx_autodoc_typehints',
       # other extensions that are preferred as per the sphinx documentation
   ]
   ```
5. Auto-generate documentation from the docstrings:

   ```bash
   sphinx-apidoc -o /path/to/the/directory/with/index.rst /path/to/the/python/package/or/code/for/which/you/are/creating/the/documenation
   ```

6. Ensure you are in the directory in which the `Makefile` is stored and create the HTML. Be sure to read the returning message from this step:
   ```bash
   make html
   ```

## Applying changes:

```bash
cd documentation && make clean && make html && cd ..
```
