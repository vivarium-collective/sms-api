## This directory contains files which pertain to running a single whole cell model (SWCM)
#### This serves as the core model upon which inference-based payloads are based.

### Contents:
1. `default.json`: A vEcoli-compliant (v1) config file which can be directly parsed by
    the `EcoliSim` object, representing the core SWCM
2. `composite.json`: A process-bigraph-compliant full composition for the core SWCM 
    TODO: Get this from ryan.
